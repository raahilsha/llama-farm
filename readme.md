Llama Farm - A CS51 Final
=========================

This project, Llama Farm, attempts to simulate a llama farm using advanced algorithmic techniques. It was created by [Raahil Sha](mailto:raahilsha@college.harvard.edu) and [Humza Tahir](mailto:htahir@college.harvard.edu) as a final project for Spring Semester 2015 of CS51.

In this readme, we will post our progress on the project so far, as well as our roadmap to project completion.
