Llama Farm - A CS51 Final
=========================

This project, Llama Farm, attempts to simulate a llama farm using advanced algorithmic techniques. It was created by [Raahil Sha](mailto:raahilsha@college.harvard.edu) and [Humza Tahir](mailto:htahir@college.harvard.edu) as a final project for Spring Semester 2015 of CS51.

In this readme, we will post our progress on the project so far, as well as our roadmap to project completion.

Progress Report
---------------
Week 1
The majority of important work completed this week is in LlamaFarm/src/Gene.java. You can find our implementation of a genetic base here. One thing to note is that in our algorithm, each chromosome only contains 1 gene.
* Finished setting up Github for project management
* Finished writing LlamaFarm.java
* Created the basic outline of GamePanel.java using the Swing Framework
* Create the signatures of every single class that we will implement
* Fully provide implementation for the Gene class

Timeline
--------
Before functionality checkpoint:

1. Finish implementing Llama class
2. Finish implementing GameWorld class
3. Add minimal implementation to Tile class for rendering
4. In GamePanel, create code to manage and run simulation

Before final project submission:

1. Continue working in GamePanel for simulation management
2. Focus more on accessory and optional features
3. Finish implementing project
4. Eat more cookies
5. Read more books
6. Create documentation
